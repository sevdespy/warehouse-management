The project focuses on developing a Warehouse Management System (WMS) based on the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) methodology for Totomak Company. 
It comprises two main components: shelf allocation and forklift movement optimization. Python is utilized to implement these components through "main.py" and "model2.py" scripts. 
The former allocates shelves for the A products group using various algorithms, ensuring efficient inventory management. The latter minimizes forklift movements by optimizing paths, resulting in time and energy savings. 
An Excel user interface facilitates user interaction, enabling operations within Excel. Integration of Python and Excel ensures seamless data transfer. Overall, the project aims to create a comprehensive WMS that optimizes shelf allocation and forklift movements.
